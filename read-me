This notebook showcases the results of applying three different algorithms based on YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m) for 
Computer Vision Predictions. Also there is an insights analysis efered to each of the algoriyhms,  based on those obtained 
results, taking into account the target (detecting 'car' instances in the images).

For running the notebook, there must be uncomprised the folders train, test & val
